# SQL | POWER BI
<br/>Dashboard designed to provide a comprehensive overview of sales and customer data from a scale model vehicle factory using SQL to conduct RFM Analysis for customer segmentation and Power BI to craft an interactive and informative dashboard.<br/>
<br/>**Key Features:**
•	Sales Revenue Analysis.
•	Customer Data Segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.
•	Insightful Visualizations.
•	Customizable Reports.<br/>

<br/>**RFM Analysis in SQL**<br/>
 It is an indexing technique that uses past purchase behaviour to segment customers. An RFM report is a way of segmenting customers using three key metrics:
•	Recency: How long ago their last purchase was?
•	Frequency: How often they purchase?
•	Monetary value: How much they spent?
<br/>Data points used in RFM Analysis:<br/>
•	Recency = last order date
•	Frequency = Count of total orders
•	Monetary value = Total spent 
<br/>It was created a three separate dimensions (R, F, M) using the scale from 1 to 4 and then a single RFM score by concatenating the three scores (e.g., RFM = 321, where 3 represents high recency, 2 represents medium frequency, and 1 represents low monetary value).<br/>
<br/>The segment was defined was follows:<br/>
High-Value Customers: High R, High F, High M
New Customers: High R, Low F, Low M
Loyal Customers: High F, High M
Churning Customers: Low R, Low F, Low M
<br/>Below is my code in SQL to define RFM segments:<br/>

with RFM as
(
select
	CUSTOMERNAME,
	sum(SALES) as monetary_value,
	avg(SALES) as avg_monetary_value,
	count(distinct ORDERNUMBER) as frequency,
	max(ORDERDATE) as last_order_date,
	(
		select max(ORDERDATE)
		from [Projects].[dbo].[sales_data_samp]
	) as max_order_date,
	DATEDIFF(DD, max(ORDERDATE), (select max(ORDERDATE) from [Projects].[dbo].[sales_data_samp])) as recency
from [Projects].[dbo].[sales_data_samp]
group by CUSTOMERNAME
),
calc_rfm as
(
	select R.*,
		NTILE(4) OVER (order by recency desc) as rfm_recency,
		NTILE(4) OVER (order by frequency) as rfm_frequency,
		NTILE(4) OVER (order by monetary_value) as rfm_monetary
	from RFM as R
)
select C.*,
	rfm_recency + rfm_frequency + rfm_monetary as RFM_cell,
	cast(rfm_recency as varchar) + cast(rfm_frequency as varchar) + cast(rfm_monetary as varchar) as RFM_column
into #RFM
from calc_rfm as C

select 
	CUSTOMERNAME,
	rfm_recency , 
	rfm_frequency,
	rfm_monetary,
	RFM_column,
	case
		when RFM_column in (111, 112, 121, 122, 123, 132, 211, 212, 221, 222) then 'Churning Customers'
		when RFM_column in (133, 144, 223, 232, 233, 234, 244) then 'Loyal Customers'
		when RFM_column in (311, 322, 332, 412, 421, 422) then 'New Customers'
		when RFM_column in (333, 343, 344, 423, 433, 434, 443, 444) then 'High-Value Customers'
	end as RFM_segment
from #RFM

I used the following skills to manipulate the data and create the dashboard in Power BI:
- Slicers
- DAX functions
- Charting
- Formatting
- Power Query
- Data manipulation
